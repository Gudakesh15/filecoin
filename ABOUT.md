# About ProofVault

## Problem Statement

In today's digital landscape, document authenticity and integrity verification remains a critical challenge across industries. Traditional centralized verification systems suffer from single points of failure, lack transparency, and require trust in intermediary authorities. Organizations struggle with document tampering, fraudulent certifications, and the inability to provide immutable proof of document authenticity over time. Legal disputes, academic fraud, and business contract manipulation highlight the urgent need for a trustless, transparent verification system that doesn't rely on centralized authorities.

## Solution

ProofVault addresses these challenges by leveraging blockchain technology to create an immutable, decentralized document verification platform. Our solution enables users to register documents on the Filecoin blockchain, generating cryptographic hashes (SHA-256) and Content Identifiers (CIDs) that serve as tamper-proof fingerprints. The platform supports both self-verification and third-party verification workflows, creating a comprehensive audit trail that can be independently verified by anyone. By eliminating centralized authorities, ProofVault provides trustless document authentication with complete transparency and permanence.

## Architecture

ProofVault employs a modular, Web3-native architecture built on three core layers:

**Smart Contract Layer**: Deployed on Filecoin Calibration testnet, our Solidity smart contract manages document registration, verification requests, and maintains an immutable ledger of all verification activities. The contract implements OpenZeppelin's security standards with reentrancy protection and proper access controls.

**Frontend Layer**: A modern React 18 application with Vite build optimization, featuring Wagmi v2 for type-safe blockchain interactions and Web3Modal v4 for universal wallet connectivity. The modular component architecture ensures scalability and maintainability.

**Integration Layer**: Seamless Web3 integration through MetaMask wallet connectivity, with robust error handling, transaction retry mechanisms, and real-time blockchain state management.

## Modular Worlds Track

**Target Track: Secure Systems**

ProofVault directly addresses the Secure Systems track by implementing cryptographic security, blockchain immutability, and decentralized verification mechanisms. Our platform eliminates single points of failure inherent in centralized verification systems while providing cryptographically secure document authentication. The solution demonstrates how modular blockchain architecture can create robust, tamper-resistant verification systems that maintain security without sacrificing usability.
